# Challenges Overview

This repository contains a collection of self-designed Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and SOLID principle challenges, organized into **four levels of difficulty**: **Beginner**, **Intermediate**, **Advanced**, and **Expert**. Each level builds on the previous one, progressively increasing in complexity while reinforcing fundamental design principles.

## Beginner Level
The **Beginner** level introduces core OOP concepts and practices, such as encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction, as well as foundational SOLID principles. These challenges focus on understanding basic object behavior, creating simple systems, and ensuring maintainable code.

- **Key Concepts**: 
  - Encapsulation
  - Abstraction
  - Inheritance
  - Polymorphism
  - Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
  - Open/Closed Principle (OCP)

- **Example Challenges**:
  - User Profile Manager
  - Shape Area Calculator
  - Simple Bank Account
  - Notification Sender
  - Book Library

## Intermediate Level
The **Intermediate** level dives deeper into more complex designs, emphasizing patterns like **Strategy** and **Dependency Injection**. You’ll explore more advanced SOLID principles and learn how to refactor code to allow for greater flexibility and extensibility while keeping systems modular.

- **Key Concepts**: 
  - Strategy Pattern
  - Dependency Injection
  - Polymorphism
  - Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
  - Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

- **Example Challenges**:
  - Payment Processing System
  - Employee Salary Calculator
  - Logging Framework
  - Smart Home Devices
  - Online Order System

## Advanced Level
The **Advanced** level challenges you to build more sophisticated systems where you’ll implement complex architectural patterns and ensure that your designs can scale and adapt to new requirements. This level emphasizes **composition over inheritance**, **factory patterns**, and **dependency inversion**.

- **Key Concepts**: 
  - Factory Pattern
  - Composition
  - Dependency Inversion
  - Open/Closed at Scale
  - Liskov Substitution

- **Example Challenges**:
  - Report Generation System
  - Game Character System
  - File Storage System
  - E-Commerce Shipping Calculator
  - Authentication System

## Expert Level
The **Expert** level introduces large-scale system designs and highly decoupled, flexible architectures. Here, you will be tasked with designing systems that are **open for extension but closed for modification** while ensuring **testability**, **extensibility**, and **maintainability**. This level utilizes **command patterns**, **plugin systems**, and **event-driven architectures** to create robust, flexible solutions.

- **Key Concepts**: 
  - Command Pattern
  - Event-Driven Architecture
  - Observer Pattern
  - Factory/Strategy Patterns
  - Advanced Dependency Injection

- **Example Challenges**:
  - Workflow Engine
  - Plugin-Based Application
  - Event-Driven Notification System
  - Multi-Tenant Billing System
  - Rule-Based Decision Engine
